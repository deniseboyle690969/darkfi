# target function approximation

excluding use of floats, and division, only +,-,* are allowed.

# consequences

- hard coded tunning.
- public reward function.

# comparison of original target to approximation

# conclusion

as the derivative of deltas graph shows, starting for term 2, the derivatives is ~ 0, and it's the optimal number of terms in approximation accuracy that has the least number of terms.
