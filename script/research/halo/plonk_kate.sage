# x_1 * x_1 = x_2
# x_3 * x_3 = x_4
# x_5 * x_5 = x_6
# x_2 + x_4 = x_6
#
# In order to satisfy these constraints, we need to supply six numbers
# as wire values that make all of the equations correct.
# e.g. x=(3, 9, 4, 16, 5, 25) would work.

# A full PLONK gate looks like this:
# (q_L)*a + (q_R)*b + (q_O)*c + (q_M)*a*b + q_C = 0
#
# Where a, b, c are the left, right, output wires of the gate.
#
# a + b = c  ---> q_L=1 , q_R=1, q_O=-1, q_M=0, q_C = 0
# a * b = c  ---> q_O=-1, q_M=1, and the rest = 0
#
# To bind a variable to a public value:
# q_R = q_O = q_M = 0
# q_L = 1
# q_C = public_value
#
# Considering all inputs as private, we get these four PLONK gates
# representing our circuit:
# 0*a_1 + 0*b_1 + (-1)*c_1 + 1*a_1*b_1 + 0 = 0    (a_1 * b_1 = c_1)
# 0*a_2 + 0*b_2 + (-1)*c_2 + 1*a_2*b_2 + 0 = 0    (a_2 * b_2 = c_2)
# 0*a_3 + 0*b_3 + (-1)*c_3 + 1*a_3*b_3 + 0 = 0    (a_3 * b_3 = c_3)
# 1*a_4 + 1*b_4 + (-1)*c_4 + 0*a_4*b_4 + 0 = 0    (a_4 + b_4 = c_4)

# a_i (left) values will be (3, 4, 5, 9)
