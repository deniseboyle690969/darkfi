DarkFi Testnet User Guide
=========================

This document presents a short user guide for the initial DarkFi
testnet. In it, we cover basic setup of the `darkfid` node daemon,
initializing a wallet, and interacting with the _money contract_,
which provides infrastructure for payments and atomic swaps.

1. [Compile and run a node](testnet/node.md)
2. [Airdrop yourself funds](testnet/airdrop.md)
3. [Make some payments](testnet/payment.md)
4. [Do some atomic swaps](testnet/atomic-swap.md)
