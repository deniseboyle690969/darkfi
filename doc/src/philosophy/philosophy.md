## State Civilization and the Democratic Nation

**State civilization** has a 5000 year history. The origin of civilizations in mesopotamia
experienced a cambrian explosion of various forms. The legacy of state civilization
can be traced back to ancient assyria which was essentially a military dictatorship
that mobilized all of society's resources to wage war and defeat other civilizations,
enslaving them and seizing their wealth.

Wikipedia defines civilization:

> Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements divided into hierarchical
> social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations.
>
> Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature,
> including over other human beings.

However this destiny of civilization was not inherent as history teaches us.
This definition is one particular mode of civilization that become prevalent.
During human history there has been plethora forms of civilizations. Our role as
revolutionaries is to reconstruct the civilizational paradigm.

The **democratic nation** is synonymous with society, and produces all value
include that which the state extracts. Creative enterprise and wealth production
originates in society from small scale business, artisans and inventors, and
anybody driven by intent or ambition to create works.

Within society, there are multiple coexisting nations which are communities of
people sharing language, history, ethnicity or culture. For example there could
be a nation based on spiritual belief, the nation of women, or a distinct
cultural nation.

The **nation state** is an extreme variant of the state civilization tendency.
Like early state civilizations, the development of the French nation-state was
more effective at seizing the wealth of society to mobilize in war against the
existing empires of the time.

Soon after, the remaining systems were forced to
adopt the nation state system, including its ideology of **nationalism**.
It is no mistake that the nation state tends towards nationalism and fascism
including the worst genocides in human history. Nationalism is a blind religion
supplanting religious ideologies weakened by secularism. However nationalism
is separate from patriotism.

> Loving one's country for which you have struggled and fought over for centuries
> or even millenia as an ethnic community or nation, which you have made your
> homeland in this long struggle, represents a sacred value.

## Modernity and the Subject of Ideology

**Modernity** was born in the "age of reason" and represents the overturning of
prevailing religious ideas and rejection of tradition in favour of secularization.
Modernity has a mixed legacy which includes alienation, commodity festishism,
scientific positivism and rationalism.

During this period of modernity, 4 major ideologies developed, each with their
own specific subject as its focus.

* Liberalism and its subject of the individual. Individuals are atomic units
  existing under the state system which guarantees them certain bargains in
  the form of laws and rights.
* Communism which focused on the concept of class warfare, and economic justice
  through state power.
* Fascism which put the volk or state at the center of society, whereby all
  resources would be mobilized to serve the state.
* Anarchism with its critiques of power, and favouring social freedom.

The particular form of modernity that is predominant can be characterized as
**capitalist modernity**. Capitalism, otherwise referred to by others as
corporatism can be likened to a religion, whereby a particular elite class
having no ideology except self profit uses the means of the state to protect
its own interests and extract the wealth of society through nefarious means.
In some ways, it is a parasite on the state.

**Agorist free markets** is the democratic tendency of economy. The word
'economy' derives from the Ancient Greek 'oikonomos' which means household
management. Economy was during ancient periods connected with nature, the
role of motherhood, life and freedom. It was believed that wealth derived
from the quality of our lived our environments. The Kurds use the feminine
word 'mal' to refer to the house, while the masculine variant refers to
actual property. Later during the Roman period, economy came to be
understood as the accumulation of property in the form of number of slaves
owned, amount of land seized or the quantity of money.

The subject of our ideology is the moral and political society. Society exists
within a morality and a politics. Here we use politics to refer not to
red team vs blue team, but instead all social activity concerned with
our security, necessity and life. A society can only be free when it has
its own morality and politics. The state seeks to keep society weak by
depriving it of morality and replacing society's politics with statecraft.

## The Extinction of Humanity

During the 20th century, liberals, communists and fascists vyed for state power
each promising a new form of society. State power existed with these external
ideological justifications.

With the end of the soviet union, and the end of history (according to liberalism),
state power morphed into pure domination and profit. The system simply become
a managerial form of raw power over society without purpose or aim.
Wars such as Iraq were invented by neoliberals to breathe a new purpose into society.
Indeed there is no more effective means to support despotism than war.

Today the military industrial complex has grown into a gigantic leviathan that
threatens the world driving economies into an ever greater spiral of desperation.
The push the development of automated weapons, aerial drones and
[ninja missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-114_Hellfire#AGM-114R9X)
that eliminate all space for human resistance against tyranny.

Meanwhile
[social credit scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System)
is being introduced as CBDCs with incentivization schemes such as UBI.
Such systems will give more effective means for the seizure of wealth by
the state from society, centralizing economic power within an already
deeply corrupt elite class.

Liberal ideologies have made people indifferent to their own situation, turning
society inwards focused on social media, unable to organize together to
oppose rising authoritarianism. Liberalism is essentially a tendency towards
extinction or death.

## Nature, Life, Freedom

**Nature** is the center of spiritual belief. Humanity is an aspect of nature.
Nature is more than the number of trees. It is the going up, the ascending of life.
Through struggle, we overcome obstacles, becoming harder and stronger along the way.
This growth makes us more human, and closer with nature.

People naturally feel an empathy with nature such as when an animal is injured, or
generous feelings towards the young of any species. This feeling was put in us by
evolution. We feel an attachment and empathy towards our lived environment, and
want to see it improve. This feeling is mother nature speaking through us.
The more in touch we are with this deeper feeling, the more free we are since we
are able to develop as higher human beings.

Freedom does not mean the ability to be without constraint or enact any wild fantasy
at a moment's notice. Freedom means direct conscious action with power that makes
us ascend upwards. Nature is full of interwoven threads of organisms vying for influence
or power, with time doing an ordered dance punctuated by inflection points of change.
It is during those moments that our ability of foresight and prescience allow us
to deeply affect events along alternative trajectories.

## Re-Evaluating Anarchism

Anarchists had the correct critique & analysis of power. In particular seeing that
the nation state would grow into a monster that would consume society.
However they were the least equipped of all the other ideologies during modernity
to enact their vision and put their ideas into practice.

* They fell victim to the same positivist forces that they claimed to be fighting
  against.
* They lacked a coherent vision, and had little strategy or roadmap for how
  the revolution would happen.
* Their utopian demand that the state must be eliminated immediately and at all
  costs meant they were not able to plan how that would happen.
* Their opposition to all forms of authority, even legitimate leadership meant
  they were ineffective at organizing revolutionary forces.

## Revolutionary Objectives

* Our movement is primarily a spiritual one. One cannot understand christianity
  by studying its system of churches, since primarily it is a body of teachings.
  Likewise the core of our movement is in our philosophy, ideas and concepts,
  which then inform our ideas on governance and economics.
* We must build a strong intellectual fabric that innocuates us and fosters
  resilience, as well as equipping us with the means to be effective in our work.
* There are two legacies in technology. One informed by state civilization,
  and the other by society. The technology we create is to solve problems that
  society and aligned communities have.
