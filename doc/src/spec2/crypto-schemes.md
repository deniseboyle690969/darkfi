## `PoseidonHash` Function

Poseidon is a circuit friendly permutation hash function described in
the paper GKRRS2019.

| Parameter         | Setting                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| S-box             | $x → x⁵$                       |
| Full rounds       | 8                              |
| Partial rounds    | 56                             |

Our usage matches that of the halo2 library. Namely using a sponge configuration
with addition which defines the function
$$\textrm{PoseidonHash} : 𝔽ₚ × ⋯ × 𝔽ₚ → 𝔽ₚ$$

## Bulla Commitments

Given an abstract hash function such as [`PoseidonHash`](#poseidonhash-function),
we use a variant of the commit-and-reveal scheme to define anonymized
representations of objects on chain. Contracts then operate with these anonymous
representations which we call bullas.

Let $\textrm{Params} ∈ 𝔽ₚⁿ$ represent object parameters, then we can define
$$ \textrm{Bulla} : 𝔽ₚⁿ × 𝔽ₚ → 𝔽ₚ $$
$$ \textrm{Bulla}(\textrm{Params}, r) = \textrm{PoseidonHash}(\textrm{Params}, r) $$
where $r ∈ 𝔽ₚ$ is a random blinding factor.

Then the bulla (on chain anonymized representation) can be used in contracts
with ZK proofs to construct statements on $\textrm{Params}$.
