priority: immediate

* delete init() rpc
        * we don't need this as we will just call initialize automatically on first run.

* split demo() into smaller functions that correspond with rpc requests
        * see comments on main.rs
        * these are super basic/ dumb right now, we will start small and gradually improve

* make main() into an async daemon
        * rpc interface must detach in the background so we can run other
        methods
        * can use darkfi::util::cli::async_daemonize to be standard with
        other binaries, but it's not essential for this demo as we do
        not need a config or options rn.

priority: mid

* move schema.rs to darkfi/example
        * rename it to dao.rs
        * we want to be able to run it like how we run example/tx.rs
        * cargo run --example dao
        * and it should compile and work

* figure out where to put example()
        * we have contract/example_contract 
        * the contract code can stay put, but where should we run it? the code
        * example() which shows the usage is also useful to have.

priority: low

* the things in util.rs are not all utils
        * some of them should be moved to other modules eventually

* rename [foo]_contract to just foo
        * contract/dao_contract/ is redundant
        * we can just have contract/dao
